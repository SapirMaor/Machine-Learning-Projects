The project aimed to develop an accurate classifier using a dataset divided into train, dev, and test sets.

Preliminary Data Analysis:
- Explored dataset features, samples, and distributions.
- Visualized key aspects for better understanding.

Model Exploration:
- Tried different classifiers, justifying selections based on experimental results.
- Documented model performances on the dev set.

Preprocessing Steps:
- Applied various preprocessing techniques and demonstrated their impact on model accuracy through experiments.

Evaluation Metric:
- Described chosen metrics for evaluating the model on the dev set, aligning with project objectives.

Hyperparameter Search:
- Conducted systematic hyperparameter search, assessing each parameter's impact on model accuracy.
- Justified final hyperparameter choices based on search results.

Training and Evaluation:
- Trained the final model on the train set using optimal hyperparameters.
- Evaluated model performance on the dev set, reporting results with chosen evaluation metrics.

Test Set Results:
- Presented results on the test set, maintaining consistency with evaluation metrics used in the experimentation phase.
